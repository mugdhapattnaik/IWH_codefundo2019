### Challenge: 
Build a Proof-of-Concept to demonstrate how you can make elections, referenda, and polls more secure, reliable, and transparent using Azure Blockchain.

### Abstract:
Prior to the most recent election, many of us had to go through the tedious process of getting our voter IDs done as we had all just turned 18. Even so, a majority of us did not receive our voter IDs in time and we lost out our chance to cast a vote and exercise our constitutional right. We hope to tackle this problem and ease the process of application and issue of voter ID to eligible citizens. 

### Idea: 
For our solution to this problem, we will build a decentralised app, using Solidity for blockchain, which we shall deploy on Microsoft Azure. 
The user would be asked to give their Aadhaar number and scan their fingerprint using the device’s scanner (most smartphones have the fingerprint scanner). This fingerprint would then be checked against the fingerprint stored in UIDAI database. 
The verification of the eligible citizen would be done using Aadhaar card and biometrics (specifically fingerprints). This will ensure that fake voter IDs are not being issued. 
Once verified, the voter ID would be issued to the citizen. 
Another problem that we would be tackling is the mutability(i.e., tendency to change) of the current voter’s list. During the previous election season, it was found that many registered voters had their names missing from the voters' list; this was solely due to the inefficiency of the current system. 
This problem would be solved by using blockchains as they are immutable and thus cannot be easily tampered with. Blockchains can also ensure unlinkability between the voter and his/her cast vote, maintaining anonymity. 

Another feature of our app will aim to empower the citizens with knowledge regarding elections. It will provide the citizens with information about upcoming elections. It will also contain useful data about the participating candidates which would help voters make an informed decision while voting. 

It is about time we introduce technology into voting to make this process more smooth and efficient.

### Future scope of this idea: 
In times to come, our app will make it easier for people who don’t live in their registered constituency to also cast a vote.
Citizens can further be informed about their local polling booths using Google Maps API and GPS tracking.
